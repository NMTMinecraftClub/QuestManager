QuestMananager TODO List
========================

<<< If you are unfamiliar with .md, I'm using the wiki page for it (wiki Markdown and you should get there). >>>

Listed here are some things that need or are wanted to be included in QM.  
Things that are needed before launch of the plugin, things that are needed for a successfull plugin, and things that would be cool all have an appropriate section.

Needed
------

### For a complete QM

+ A nice party interface
+ The ability to drop quests
+ Fame merchants

+ Character trades (increase character stats, see above)

Extra Features
--------------

+ API capability (program your own very customized quests by getting API access
  to QM)
+ Visual information, like hovering text over monsters or party members, etc
+ Add a graphical editor for quest configuration files
